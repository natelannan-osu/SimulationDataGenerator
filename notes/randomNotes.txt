Finished importing bvh and smpl files
things got sticky trying to retarget the smpl to the bvh motion
decided to punt and use makehuman plugin with rokoko in blender

Makehuman addon
	called MPFV v2 and is available to download through githubas a zip
		I then installed it through edit -> preferences -> addon -> install from disk
	used rigify to rig it.  installed through blender's edit->preferences -> plugins didn't work as well as 
		rigging with built in rigging system with the CMU skeleton
	used rokoko to retarget.  installed a rokoko zip just like MPFV2

creating a new human in MPFV2
	type 'n' in blender to bring up tools and select mpfv2 tab
	new human
	from scratch -> select preferences (no breast targets, no phenotypes, no extra vertex groups)
	create human
	after creating, slect rigging
	add rig -> add standard rig -> chose CMU MB option
	create rig
	select human.rig in scene collection window
	go back to MPFB -> rigging -> load pose
	Pose: t-pose, load pose

BVH and matching
	import bvh make scale CMU scaling:0.056444
	in modeling tab, object mode move bvh skeleton
	hide human skin
	switch to pose mode and rotate bvh bones to match human

IK retargeting
	select Rokoko tab
	go to retargeting
	select source (cmu) and target (makehuman rig)
	build bone list
	modify if needed, bones should match 1 to 1 but sometimes app makes errors

	I selected autoscale and Use Pose: Current
	select retarget animation
	Blender will remember the Rokoko Studio Live retargeting options (like "Use Current Pose" and "Autoscale") across sessions, but not per .blend file. Here's what that means in practice:
    	Once you check “Use Current Pose” and “Autoscale” in the Retargeting panel, Blender stores these settings in your user preferences or internal state.

    	As long as:
        	Blender remains open, or
        	You haven’t reset user preferences or the add-on state, then future calls to bpy.ops.rsl.retarget_animation() will use those saved settings, even if you open a different .blend file.
